# Roll-a-ball-code

The code for my Roll-a-ball Unity game.  The aim of the game is to collect 
cubes scattered around a randomly generated maze whilst avoiding clones of 
yourself which regularly spawn and follow your previous movement patterns.

### Instructions

WASD or arrows keys to move.  

You win by collecting all 10 yellow cubes which are all located in the 
southwest corner of the maze.

### Changes yet to be made

Spread the yellow cubes randomly across the entire maze.

Make the maze easier by creating extra random routes through the maze.

Add walls to the edges of the maze to stop the player escaping.

Stop the game when you win.
